The primary navigation menu is at the top of the website and contains links to "Category", "Wishlist", "Cart", "Personal details", and other options. Users may also use the search box situated in the header to look for certain products.
Giftify also provides a number of valuable tools to improve the gift-giving experience.

Fast shipping alternatives are also available to guarantee that presents arrive on time.

Technology used:
Giftify was created with React on the front end and Redux on the back end. The HTML and CSS were built to create a responsive design that works on all devices. The development environment was Visual Studio Code.
Future Scope 
1. Improved Personalization: Giftify now offers personalised suggestions based on user preferences and purchasing history, but there is still opportunity for development. In the future, the website may use machine learning algorithms to deliver even more precise and personalised gift recommendations. This might entail assessing user behaviours and other data to provide suggestions depending on the recipient's age, gender, hobbies, and personality.
2. One of the most difficult aspects of internet purchasing is the inability to view and interact with the goods in person. However, with the advent of augmented reality (AR) technology, users can now have a more immersive and interactive shopping experience. In the future, Giftify might include augmented reality elements that allow users to see how a product would appear in their house or on their person.
3. Product Offering Expansion: Giftify already provides a large choice of gift gifts, but there is always opportunity for growth. In the future, the website's offers might be expanded to cover other categories such as home decor, technology, or outdoor items. Furthermore, Giftify could explore collaborations with other retailers in order to provide a more comprehensive service.
4. Integration with Virtual Assistants: As virtual assistants like as Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant gain popularity, there is a rising desire for voice-activated shopping experiences. Giftify may investigate integration with these sites in the future to deliver a smooth and hands-free gift-shopping experience.
Finally, Giftify has a lot of room for future growth and development. The website can continue to deliver a good service to its clients while staying ahead of the competition by using new technology and extending its offers.
